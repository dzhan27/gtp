# gtp
Final project for evolutionary game theory

Currently ran by just running gtp.py.

Contains 3 files:

- gtp.py: The main program and currently contains most of the code. Can be run to execute the program
- learning_dynamics.py: This contains the learning dynamics interface and a basic replicator implementation. Still needs work.
- strategies.py: This contains the base class for strategies. May want to prepopulate with strategies.
